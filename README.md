# Collaboration Guidelines

- **Workflow**: Create a feature branch for your changes, then open a Pull Request (PR) into `main`. Keep PRs small and focused on one topic.
- **Scope**: Only edit the content for your assigned section (e.g., files in `sections/` or your dedicated part in `project.tex`). Avoid touching other teammates' sections unless you coordinate first.
- **Communication**: In your PR description, list what you changed, which section it affects, and any questions or blockers. Tag teammates who are impacted.
- **Reviews**: Wait for at least one peer review before merging. Address comments by pushing new commits to the same branch (no force-push after review starts).
- **Quality checks**: Ensure the document compiles (`latexmk` or your LaTeX tool) before requesting review. Fix warnings relevant to your section.
- **Merging**: Use squash and merge to keep history clean once the PR is approved and checks pass.
