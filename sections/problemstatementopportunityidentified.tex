\section{Problem Statement \& Opportunity Identified}
% SECTION 3

The Internet of Things (IoT) is growing very rapidly in the residential sector; this has created a great market opportunity. There is an explosive growth in device adoption; however, this growth is inherently restrained by a critical problem: the lack of a trustworthy security and privacy framework for connected devices. This lack is caused by a widespread design decision to prioritize convenience and connectivity over robust protection which undermines user adoption.
Our main finding, as expanded upon in the market research summary, is that users are deeply concerned about data collection and device hijacking. While some security options exist, they are usually complex and designed for users with a high technical knowledge of IoT networks. This constitutes a technical barrier that makes security inaccessible to the average IoT consumer.
This shows a discrepancy between customer’s expectations of trustworthiness and the technology currently available to them and constitutes a clear market need.
